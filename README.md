# POWER SUPPLY WITH LM317
  Variable Power Supply Using LM317. This project showcases the design and construction of a variable power supply using the LM317 adjustable voltage regulator. It converts a 220V AC input to a regulated DC output, adjustable via a potentiometer. The circuit includes a transformer, bridge rectifier, smoothing capacitor, and LM317 regulator, tested with an oscilloscope and multimeter to ensure stable performance.
